# Challenges of managing multicloud environments

Whether on-premises or in the public cloud, managing compute and storage infrastructure is a significant task. Technical debt and varying organizational policies can create inconsistency among environments issues with even the smallest infrastructure changes and application deployments.

Ultimately, this situation generates administrative and maintenance overhead. The result is a manual, difficult-to-track process that contributes to errors and production churn.

## Is there a solution?

Yes, of course! By employing tools, platforms, and concepts that support DevOps, and more precisely GitOps, organizations can start to realize Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). IaC has the following benefits:

* __Repeatable__: Apply changes the same way, every time.
* __Accessible__: Anyone with the appropriate permissions can make changes.
* __Predictable__: Results are predictable and consistent
* __Trackable__: Identify who made any changes, what the changes were, and when they were made.
