# Step 3. Clone A DevNet Repo

In this step you learn how to clone the sample code for this Learning Lab from the DevNet repository on GitHub.

1. Open a terminal session. 
2. Change your working directory to the directory where you want to save the repo locally.
3. Create a new directory to hold the cloned repo. Make it your working directory:
  
  ```shell
  $ mkdir DevNet-Code-Samples
  $ cd DevNet-Code-Samples
  ```

4. Clone the repo:

  ```shell
  $ git clone https://www.github.com/CiscoDevNet/intro-to-programming-code-samples
  ```

5. List the directory contents (Mac/Linux: `ls`; Windows: `dir`) to confirm that a new subdirectory has been created containing the sample code from the repo. 

The new subdirectory is your local copy of the repo. You can use it to store and track changes you make to the sample code.
