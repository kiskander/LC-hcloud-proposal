# Cisco Hybrid Cloud Content Breadboarding


## What's The Problem?
Cisco's Hybrid Cloud is catchy and feasible given the latest product releases, investment and partnership with key players in the cloud orchestration vertical. The problem is the story is being told with no learning content to allow Cisco Community (external and internal) to learn how to construct their hybrid cloud , up skill their workforce into a true DevOps operation and grow Engineer Of The Future.
We should build content around Public and Private Cloud that clear explains, differentiates and teach the implementation of both


## What's Needed ?
New Learning content built to walk through the journey. Curriculum that is tailored for both Developers and Network Engineers. The expectation is to spend time curating new content and deliver it in a fresh, interactive, relevant and fun way. Proposed content to be released within 2-3 Months in batches. 
- Content to be interactive 
- Cross Platform integration to focus on API utilization 
- Third party open source tooling should be incorporated as part of the learning process
- Content to tell the use case from soup to nuts
- Content to be built in a modular format to resinate to different DevOps personas (Dev, SRE, Ops)
