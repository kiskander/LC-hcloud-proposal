# Cisco Hybrid Cloud Content Breadboarding


## What's The Problem?
Cisco's Hybrid Cloud story is catchy and feasible given the latest product releases, investement and partnership with key players in the cloud orchestration vertical. The problem is the story is being told with no learning content to allow Cisco Community (external and internal) to learn how to construct their hybrid cloud , up skill their workforce into a true DevOps operation and grow Engineer Of The Future.


## What's Needed ?
New Learning content built to walk through the journey. Curriculum that is tailored for both Developers and Network Engineers. The expectation is to spend time curating new content and deliver it in a fresh, interactive, relevant and fun way. Proposed content to be released within 2-3 Months in batches.
