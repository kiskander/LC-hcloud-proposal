# Cisco Hybrid Cloud


Cisco's Hybrid Cloud is about enabling Cisco customers to create extraordinary experiences by fusing the best of cloud and on-premises. Some things to keep in mind:
* Every cloud is different, and every cloud strategy is different, with customers embracing cloud in unique ways. Organizations are accelerating their cloud journey across a spectrum of motions with their main goal providing digital experiences to their users better and faster.
* The new reality is a hyper-distributed, extremely diverse IT landscape with multiple locations, remote teams and users...and across this landscape, there is one constant: change. As organizations are aiming to minimize risk while converging the existing “traditional IT” with “cloud-first” or “cloud-inspired”, the challenge is not to evolve now, but to be adaptive...always.
* Across every layer of the digital experience, customers need a cloud-neutral operating model with full-stack observability and automation to accelerate and make their clouds work smarter while maintaining control and choice.


## What is Hybrid Cloud?

Hybrid cloud integrates public cloud services, private cloud services and on-premises infrastructure and provides orchestration, management and application portability across all three. The result is a single, unified and flexible distributed computing environment where an organization can run and scale its traditional or cloud-native workloads on the most appropriate computing model.

Hybrid multicloud is hybrid cloud that includes public cloud services from more than one cloud service provider. 

By enabling a company to 

- combine best-of-breed cloud services and functionality from multiple cloud computing vendors
- choose the optimal cloud computing environment for each workload, and 
- move workloads freely between public and private cloud as circumstances change

hybrid cloud - and particularly hybrid multicloud - helps a company achieve its technical and business objectives more effectively and cost-efficiently than public cloud or private cloud alone. In fact, according to one recent study, companies derive up to 2.5x the value from hybrid cloud than from a single-cloud, single-vendor approach.
