## How does hybrid cloud work?

Traditional hybrid cloud architecture

Initially, hybrid cloud architecture focused on the mechanics of transforming portions of a company's on-premises data center into private cloud infrastructure, and then connecting that infrastructure to public cloud environments hosted off-premises by a public cloud provider (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud Services, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure). This was accomplished using a prepackaged hybrid cloud solution such as Red Hat OpenStack (link resides outside IBM) or by using sophisticated enterprise middleware to integrate cloud resources across the environments, and unified management tools for monitoring, allocating and managing those resources from a central console or 'single pane of glass.' 

**The result was unified IT infrastructure well-suited to several use cases:**

- **Security and regulatory compliance:** Reserve behind-the firewall private cloud resources for sensitive data and highly regulated workloads and use more economical public cloud resources for less-sensitive workloads and data.
- **Scalability and resilience:** U​​se public cloud compute and cloud storage resources to scale up quickly, automatically and inexpensively in response to unplanned spikes in traffic without impacting private cloud workloads (this is called 'cloudbursting).
- **Rapid adoption of new technology:** Adopt or switch to the latest software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution, and even integrate those solutions into existing applications, without provisioning new on-premises infrastructure.
- **Enhancing legacy applications:** Use public cloud services to improve the user experience of existing apps or to extend them to new devices.
VMware migration: 'Lift and shift' existing on-premises workloads to virtualized public cloud infrastructure, to reduce the on-premises data center footprint and scales as needed without additional capital equipment investment.
- **Resource optimization and cost savings:** Run workloads with predictable capacity on private cloud and migrate more variable workloads to public cloud; use public cloud infrastructure to quickly 'spin up' development and test resources as needed.


## Benefits of a unified hybrid cloud platform


A unified hybrid cloud strategy is still in its 'early adopter' phase; in a recent survey 13 percent of organizations reported they were actively using a multicloud management platform. But these organizations are already realizing significant benefits including:

- **Improved developer productivity:** A unified hybrid cloud platform can help expand adoption of Agile and DevOps methodologies, and enable development teams to develop once and deploy to all clouds.
- **Greater infrastructure efficiency:** With more granular control over resources, development and IT operations teams can optimize spend across public cloud services, private clouds, and cloud vendors. Hybrid cloud also helps companies modernize applications faster, and connect cloud services to data on cloud or on-premises infrastructure in ways that deliver new value.
- **Improved regulatory compliance and security:** A unified platform lets an organization draw on best-of-breed cloud security and regulatory compliance technologies and implement security and compliance across all environments in a consistent way.
- **Overall business acceleration:** This includes shorter product development cycles; accelerated innovation and time-to-market; faster response to customer feedback; faster delivery of applications closer to the client (e.g., edge ecommerce); and faster integration and combination with partners or third parties to deliver new products and services.
