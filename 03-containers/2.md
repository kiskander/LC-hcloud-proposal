Containers 101

# Containers: Benefits

To understand why we would want to use containers in the first place, lets look at how we would deploy our applications with and without them.

## Bare Metal or Single Host.
Applications teams used to deploy applications all onto the same server, using simple operating system packaging such as DEB or RPM, maybe with a layer of automation such as Puppet or Chef. This servers directory structure was filled with the components of many applications.

* Oldest and simplest method of deploying applications, gets messy quickly
* Usually relies on OPS team to ‘validate’ changes. "Don't touch the server"
* Conflicts between application dependancies can occur
* Hard to isolate issues
* Hard to scale or migrate applications
* Inter-app communication hard to debug

## With Virtual Machines
Operations teams then used virtualisation to gain isolation, giving each application its own VM in order to create order and repeatability. Often within each VM, the same deployment tooling (manual packages or puppet/chef etc) as in the bare metal scenario was used.

Some engineering teams realised the value of "baking" a golden VM image for each release of each application, so that new VM's could be swapped out for old ones in a near-stateless fashion, with no commands (RPM, installations, puppet etc) being needed. This allowed CI/CD systems to produce artefacts (the VM image) which could be easily deployed to production.

VM's being a full operating system however, each image still takes a while to boot and start services, so this still didn't provide on-demand scaling or the immediate healing some operations teams were looking for.

A lot of teams, continued managing the VM's manually or near-manually, purely using VM's for their isolation.

## With Containers

Imagine the pre-baked image benefits of VM's, coupled with near immediate bootup time and a lot less complexity. We don't need a whole OS in each of our images anymore, because containers run *on top* of a single operating system (all that cGroups stuff remember?) so our baked application image is now only as big as our application and it's dependancies. Easier to store, share, and deploy.

## In summary..

Containers change how we package and deploy code/files/binaries/libraries onto systems...

The rise of containers complements and *enables* a growing change in software development methodologies such as DevOPS, designed to remove roadblocks from the development process, get the developers involved in the packaging and production of their own code... getting things into production quicker.

But notice, the diagrams above were not just about Isolation....

We talked about Packaging / Baking software images.
- How is that done?

We talked about not deploying software via RPM/DEB
- So how do the images get onto the system?

We didn't even touch on how someone actually says "Start application XYZ"
- How does this happen?

On the previous page, we said it is the tools and features that have been created *around* the actual container technology, that bring the value to "containers"... such developer toolchains are the exact bits that address all these questions above.

Most people when they talk about "containers" are talking about this whole toolchain.

Consider the slide above. It shows a process for developers building, packaging, versioning and deploying their apps. The actual Cgroup technology is that tiny highlighed red box, but containers have become synonymous with the following idea:

#### It changes how developers package and deploy their apps... For the better.

And this! Is why containers matter. The whole toolchain that a developer can use to go from code, to packaged, repeatable container deployments of their app.

Docker, is one such toolchain (and by far the most popular currently) for achieving this. Read on into Docker-101 to put this deep container knowledge to work, gaining hands on skills with everything we've just discussed.
