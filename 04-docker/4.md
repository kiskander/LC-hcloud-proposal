# Building a simple webserver container.

So instead of python echoing a hello message, it can also host a simple webserver, listening for HTTP requests..

The following python command will set this up.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

So, it should be pretty easy to build a container to do this instead of our echo!

The dockerfile looks like this...

```
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get -y install python
EXPOSE 8000
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "-m", "SimpleHTTPServer", "8000"]
```

The first three lines should be farmiliar, the last two we're introducing new Dockerfile options.

### EXPOSE
Tells Docker this image expects to serve connections on a TCP/IP PORT, otherwise noone would be able to access the webserver running in the container.

### ENTRYPOINT
This is like CMD, only it allows arguments to be passed to the command, we need this as we're passing options `-m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` to the command `python`.

Save this dockerfile in a new directory and build our new webserver container image:

```
docker build .
docker run <your new container id> &
```

# Nothing happened?
This is the first time we've run the `docker run` command and seen no output, this is because our app doesn't print anything out to the screen. How do we know it's running properly?

```
docker ps
```

Gives us a list of running containers, we can see our new webserver running.

![Docker PS Webserver](https://github.com/kiskander/LC-hcloud-proposal/blob/main/04-docker/assets/images/dockerpsweb.png?raw=true)

OK, so how do we access it? By default Docker gives each container an internal IP address on the host. We can find out which one our container has using `docker inspect <container ID>`

This will output much information about our container. You'll find "IPAddress" in this output as shown below.

![Docker Inspect](https://github.com/kiskander/LC-hcloud-proposal/blob/main/04-docker/assets/images/dockerinspect.png?raw=true)

So we know which IP our container is on.. and we know we exposed port 8000.

LETS QUERY OUR WEBSERVER!

i'm using the `curl` command from our play-with-docker terminal. It's a CLI based web browser.. It will do for what we need!

```
curl http://<container IP>:8000
```

By default the webserver will serve the root directory of the container...

### Success!

![Success](https://github.com/kiskander/LC-hcloud-proposal/blob/main/04-docker/assets/images/success.png?raw=true)

And success! We see our containerised webserver giving us the directory listing back.

## Extra credit?
You know how to `ADD` files to our docker build process, so if you wrote a HTML page called `index.html` and added it to the Dockerfile, guess what new webserver container would serve instead of the directory listing?

Give it a try!


# Summary

In this learning lab we have:

* Understood docker images are built using Dockerfiles
* Understood how existing public images are built by viewing their Dockerfiles
* Built and run our own images
* Connected to a webserver running in our custom Docker container.

Give yourselves a pat on the back, grab a coffee and enjoy the suggested labs on the next page.

Thats all folks!
